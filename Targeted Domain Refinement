To address the technical bottleneck caused by the domain mismatch problem in the sim-to-real rransfer process of humanoid robots, a targeted domain refinement (TDR) framework is proposed to solve the shortcomings of adaptive domain randomization (ADR). This research design uses quantitative simulation experiments to execute the code of TDR and ADR architecture through the Python 3.13 IDLE platform. Then the sample efficiency, adaptation speed, robustness, policy stability and domain gap of synthetic data are used to compare and analyze the two frameworks. The results show that TDR outperforms ADR on five indicators. It proves that it can make up for the shortcomings of ADR in solving domain mismatch problems, and provides reference experience for future research on improving sim-to-real rransfer.
