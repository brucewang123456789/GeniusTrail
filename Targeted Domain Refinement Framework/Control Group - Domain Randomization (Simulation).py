"""
ADR Simulation (Control Group)
------------------------------
This script implements a basic Adaptive Domain Randomization (ADR) approach 
in pure Python 3.13, with no external libraries or plug-ins.

It parallels the style of the TDR modules. Each 'episode' randomizes
environment parameters (e.g., friction, slope) and then attempts a 
mock "adaptation" to these random conditions.

Usage:
  python adr_simulation.py

You can integrate this code into your existing environment logic 
or compare directly with TDR code by ensuring the same environment 
parameters, success metrics, and logging formats.
