"""
TDR Framework - Module 4: Knowledge Integration & Meta-Learning
------------------------------------------------------------------
Order of components (from bottom to top):
  (1) Episodic Memory Vault
  (2) Semantic Knowledge Graph
  (3) Meta-Learning Scheduler
      - Subcomponent: Adaptive Complexity Allocator
      - Subcomponent: Priority-Based Resource Manager
  (4) Transfer Catalysis Unit

Goal:
  - Incorporate episodic data from Module 3 into a cohesive knowledge structure.
  - Perform meta-learning that prioritizes tasks or experiences adaptively.
  - Provide a refined representation (or adapted parameters) for Module 5's Generative World Model.

Requirements:
  - Python 3.13 with no external libraries/plugins.
  - Must tie in seamlessly with the output from Module 3 (Adaptive Strategy Refinement).
  - Must surpass ADR by focusing on structured knowledge integration instead of random domain perturbations.
