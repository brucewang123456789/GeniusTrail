Multi-Scenario Reasoning for Humanoid Robots

Overview
This repository implements a multi-scenario reasoning architecture for enhancing cognitive autonomy in humanoid robots, as described in the paper "Multi-Scenario Reasoning: Unlocking Cognitive Autonomy in Humanoid Robots for Multimodal Understanding" by Libo Wang. The architecture integrates visual, auditory, and tactile data using a simulator named "Mahh" to enable dynamic multi-modal reasoning, inspired by situated cognition theory.
Features

Multi-Modal Data Integration: Combines visual, auditory, and tactile inputs for semantic alignment.
Sparse Attention Filtering: Optimizes data prioritization for efficient reasoning.
Memory-Augmented Reasoning: Utilizes short-term and long-term memory for contextual analysis.
Sim2Real Module: Maps simulated plans to real-world actions via domain randomization.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and accuracy for performance assessment.

Installation
git clone https://github.com/username/multi-scenario-reasoning.git
cd multi-scenario-reasoning
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Set up the environment per docs/installation.md.
Run simulations: python scripts/run_mahh_simulation.py --modalities visual auditory tactile.
View results in outputs/results/.

Results
The Mahh simulator achieves high precision (0.93) and recall (0.91) on visual synthetic data, with an F1-score of 0.92, demonstrating robust multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
