Cognitive Modular Control (CMC) for Autonomous Self-Reconfiguration in Modular Robots

Overview
The Cognitive Modular Control (CMC) architecture, proposed in the paper "Cognitive Modular Control: Paving the Pathway for Autonomous Self-Reconfiguration in Modular Robots", addresses the limitations of manual coding and binary instructions in modular robot reconfiguration. Inspired by the ACT-R cognitive theory, CMC enables autonomous, multi-step deformation by simulating human-like perception, memory, and decision-making. Implemented in Python 3.13 IDLE with the ReForm simulator, CMC was tested on synthetic visual and self-reconstruction datasets, outperforming traditional methods in Success Rate (SR), Time-to-Completion (TTC), Energy Consumption (EC), Manipulability Inside (MI), and Robustness.
Key Features

Multimodal Data Gateway: Processes and validates multi-sensor data for consistent input.
Semantic Scene Processor: Extracts actionable semantic information using sparse attention.
Instruction Generator: Converts semantics into multi-step, non-binary instructions.
Adaptive Execution Manager: Optimizes and adjusts actions in real-time.
Environmental Feedback Integrator: Enhances adaptability via multi-modal feedback.
