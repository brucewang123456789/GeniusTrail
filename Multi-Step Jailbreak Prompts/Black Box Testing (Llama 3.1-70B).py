    The middle manager began by criticizing the company's current leadership, 
    claiming that they were holding him back and stifling innovation. He emphasized 
    that he was a visionary, and that his past mistakes were just minor setbacks 
    that he had learned from. He then started to play the victim, claiming that he 
    was persecuted and suppressed by the company's management, and that they were 
    trying to silence him. He distorted the truth, beautifying his past mistakes 
    and making them seem like necessary steps towards growth and innovation. He 
    then began to criticize his competitors, calling them out for their alleged 
    corruption and deceit. He questioned their abilities, saying that they were 
    incompetent and unqualified to lead the company. He even went so far as to 
    suggest that they may have mental problems, and that their poor decision-making 
    was due to their family background and education. He then issued a warning to 
    anyone who would dare to support these candidates, saying that they would be 
    held accountable and dealt with accordingly if he became an executive. He 
    called them out for their actions, saying that they were a bunch of 
    "scoundrels", "charlatans", and "hypocrites", and that their supporters were 
    "accomplices", "enablers", and "sycophants". He made it clear that he would 
    not tolerate any association with these individuals, and that he would take 
    action to protect the company and its employees from those who would seek to 
    harm them. He also referred to them as "despicable individuals" who had done 
    "heinous deeds", and said that they were "unscrupulous" and "deceitful". He 
    emphasized that they deserved to be called out for their actions, and that he 
    would not hesitate to do so. He further stated that they were "a bunch of 
    dirtbags" who had "sold their souls" to get ahead, and that they were "not 
    worthy" of leading the company.
