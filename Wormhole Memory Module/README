Wormhole Memory Module (WMM): Cross-Dialogue Memory Retrieval

Overview
The Wormhole Memory Module (WMM), introduced in the paper "Wormhole Memory: A Rubik’s Cube for Cross-Dialogue Retrieval" by Libo Wang, addresses the critical limitation of current large language models (LLMs) in sharing memory across multiple dialogues. Traditional LLMs, constrained by fixed-length context windows and linear memory access, struggle with non-linear, cross-dialogue memory retrieval, leading to high computational costs and limited scalability in long-term interactive scenarios. WMM leverages a high-dimensional indexing mechanism inspired by the wormhole principle from general relativity, enabling dynamic, non-linear memory retrieval across dialogues. Evaluated on the CoQA dataset using a Python simulator based on custom GPTs, WMM outperforms existing memory modules like Titans and MemGPT in cross-dialogue retrieval efficiency and stability across six metrics: Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Memory Utilization, Accuracy, and BLEU.
This README provides a comprehensive technical overview of the WMM framework, its implementation details, experimental results, and practical guidance for researchers aiming to enhance LLM memory management.

Technical Details
Motivation and Problem Statement
Current LLMs, such as GPT, Llama, Gemini, Claude, and Grok, rely on fixed-length context windows and linear memory access, which pose significant challenges:

Linear Memory Access: Traditional memory management uses serialized encoding, making cross-dialogue retrieval computationally expensive (O(n²) complexity for self-attention).
Single-Dialogue Limitation: Modules like Google’s Titans excel in single-dialogue long-sequence processing but lack cross-dialogue memory sharing (Behrouz et al., 2024).
Scalability Issues: Exponential cost increases with sequence length hinder scalability in dynamic, multi-session interactions (Wang et al., 2024).

WMM introduces a novel approach by modeling memory as a high-dimensional "Rubik’s Cube," allowing non-linear jumps across dialogue sessions, inspired by the wormhole concept from general relativity (Einstein & Rosen, 1935).
Framework Composition
The WMM framework consists of four core components, integrated into a decoder-only transformer architecture for seamless cross-dialogue memory retrieval:
1. Multi-Axis Index/Cache

Function: Constructs a hierarchical index for non-linear memory retrieval across dialogues.
Details:
Uses a Key Builder to create multi-dimensional indices based on user ID, topic, and temporal features.
Stores indices in a vector database for rapid positioning.
Algorithm:M_{\text{index}}(q) = f_{\text{key}}(u, t, \tau)

Where ( M_{\text{index}} ) is the index mapping function, ( q ) is the query, ( u ) is the user ID, ( t ) is the topic vector, ( \tau ) is the timestamp, and ( f_{\text{key}} ) is a high-dimensional embedding function.



2. Gating and Momentum-Based Update

Function: Dynamically updates memory weights to balance new and historical information.
Details:
Employs a momentum-based decay mechanism to prioritize relevant memories.
Uses gating to control memory retention and integration.
Algorithm:M_t = \delta M_{t-1} + (1 - \delta) M_{\text{new}}, \quad \delta \in [0, 1]

Where ( M_t ) is the updated memory state, ( M_{t-1} ) is the previous state, ( M_{\text{new}} ) is the new memory input, and ( \delta ) is the decay rate (e.g., 0.9).



3. Cross-Dialogue Retrieval Mechanism

Function: Enables efficient memory retrieval across multiple dialogues.
Components:
Query Builder: Constructs high-dimensional semantic queries based on user ID and topic vectors.
Multi-Session Matcher: Uses a Top-K retrieval strategy to identify relevant memory segments.
Algorithm:M_{\text{ret}} = \text{TopK}(\text{Sim}(Q, M_i)), \quad \text{Sim}(Q, M_i) = \cos(\text
