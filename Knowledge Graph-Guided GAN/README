Knowledge Graph-Guided GAN for Hyper-Personalized Smart Glasses Design

Overview
This repository implements the Knowledge Graph-Guided GAN (KGG-GAN) framework, as described in the paper "Enhancing Hyper-Personalization in Smart Glasses Design with a Knowledge Graph-Guided GAN Framework" submitted anonymously to CVPR. The framework integrates a knowledge graph with a generative adversarial network (GAN) to enable hyper-personalized design for smart glasses, addressing the limitations of static, rule-based personalization in current AI-driven smart glasses. By combining structured semantic constraints from the knowledge graph with GAN's generative capabilities, KGG-GAN dynamically adapts UI layouts, interaction models, and hardware designs to user preferences and market demands. The framework was tested using a Python simulator based on custom GPTs with synthetic datasets for image recognition and text generation, demonstrating stable performance across multiple metrics.
This README provides a detailed technical breakdown of the KGG-GAN framework, its implementation, experimental results, and practical insights for researchers and developers in AI-driven wearable technology.

Technical Details
Motivation and Problem Statement
Current smart glasses rely on static, rule-based personalization, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse user needs and dynamic market demands. Key challenges include:

Static Design Mechanisms: Preset parameters and fixed rules hinder real-time adaptation to user behavior.
Lack of Data-Driven Decision-Making: Product development often depends on ex-ante market forecasts rather than real-time user data.
Uncontrolled GAN Outputs: Traditional GANs lack semantic and structural constraints, making them unsuitable for complex, multi-dimensional design tasks like smart glasses.

KGG-GAN addresses these gaps by integrating a knowledge graph to provide structured, domain-specific constraints, enabling GANs to generate semantically consistent and personalized designs.
Framework Composition
The KGG-GAN framework consists of five core modules, each contributing to hyper-personalized design generation:
1. Data Ingestion and Knowledge Graph Construction

Function: Aggregates heterogeneous data (historical design data, user logs, ergonomic standards, domain constraints) into a knowledge graph.
Details:
Data Sources:
Historical Data and Specs: Technical specifications and industrial standards.
User Logs: Interaction behaviors (e.g., usage frequency, scene preferences).
Ergonomic Standards: Anthropometric data for comfort and usability.
Domain Constraints: Regulatory and market requirements.


Knowledge Graph Structure: Nodes represent design attributes (e.g., optical quality, battery performance); edges define semantic relationships.
Algorithm:G = (V, E), \quad V = \{v_i\}, \quad E = \{(v_i, v_j, a_{ij})\}

Where ( G ) is the knowledge graph, ( V ) is the set of nodes, ( E ) is the set of edges, and ( a_{ij} ) is the weight of the edge between nodes ( v_i ) and ( v_j ).



2. GNN Embedding Layer

Function: Converts knowledge graph data into high-dimensional vectors for neural network processing.
Details:
Uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to aggregate neighbor node information via message passing.
Captures global graph structure and local relationships.
Algorithm:h_v^{(k)} = \sigma\left(W^{(k)} \cdot \sum_{u \in N(v)} a_{uv} \cdot h_u^{(k-1)}\right)

Where ( h_v^{(k)} ) is the embedding of node ( v ) at layer ( k ), ( N(v) ) is the neighborhood of ( v ), ( a_{uv} ) is the edge weight, ( W^{(k)} ) is the learnable parameter matrix, and ( \sigma ) is the ReLU activation.



3. Conditional Generator

Function: Generates personalized design variants based on knowledge graph embeddings, user preferences, and noise vectors.
Details:
Integrates condition vectors (combining graph embeddings, user preferences, and historical data) with random noise.
Ensures compliance with engineering and ergonomic constraints.
Algorithm:x_{\text{gen}} = G(z, \text{Condition}, \theta_g) = f_g(W_g [z \oplus \text{Condition}] + b_g)

Where ( x_{\text{gen}} ) is the generated design, ( z ) is the noise vector, ( \text{Condition} = [E_{KG}, p, d] ) (with ( E_{KG} ) as graph embedding, ( p ) as user preferences, ( d ) as historical data), ( W_g ) and ( b_g ) are generator weights and bias, and ( f_g ) is a nonlinear mapping.



4. Graph Discriminator

Function: Evaluates generated designs for realism and adherence to knowledge graph constraints.
Details:
Performs binary classification and calculates constraint matching scores.
Ensures generated designs align with semantic and technical requirements.
Algorithm:p_{\text{real}} = D(x, \text{Condition}, \theta_d) = \sigma(W_d [x \oplus \text{Condition}] + b_d)

Where ( p_{\text{real}} ) is the probability of realism, ( x ) is the input design (real or generated), ( W_d ) and ( b_d ) are discriminator weights and bias, and ( \sigma ) is the sigmoid activation.



5. Semantic Rewrite Module

Function: Adjusts node parameters to enhance semantic convergence and correct generation errors.
Details:
Uses backpropagation loss to penalize designs violating constraints.
Iteratively refines node weights and embeddings.
Algorithm:L_D = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{real}}}[\log D(x, \text{Condition})] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log (1 - D(G(z, \text{Condition}), \text{Condition}))]

Where ( L_D ) is the discriminator loss, balancing real and generated design evaluations.



Experimental Setup
Environment

Platform: Python 3.13 IDLE with a custom GPT-based Python simulator for dynamic node adjustments and semantic monitoring.
Rationale: The simulator supports real-time condition adjustments and structured output, ideal for testing multi-module interactions without hardware dependencies.

Dataset

Source: Two synthetic datasets:
Image-Based Diary Notes: 1000 samples simulating visual style preferences.
Text-Based User Logs: 3000 JSON-formatted samples for semantic generation.


Reasoning: Synthetic data allows controlled node perturbations and semantic calibration, compensating for the lack of real-world smart glasses datasets.

Implementation

Code Development: Written in Python 3.13 IDLE, initializing KGG-GAN modules (graph embedder, generator, discriminator, semantic rewrite).
Execution:
Initialized node dimensions, edge weights, and semantic tags in JSON format.
Ran image and text generation tasks with node perturbations to test style transfer and semantic consistency.
Repeated experiments to mitigate simulator deviations, selecting optimal results.
