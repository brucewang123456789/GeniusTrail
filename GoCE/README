Graph-of-Causal Evolution (GoCE)

Overview
This repository implements the Graph-of-Causal Evolution (GoCE) framework, introduced in the paper "Graph-of-Causal Evolution: Challenging Chain-of-Model for Reasoning" by Libo Wang. GoCE enhances transformer architectures by addressing the limitations of Chain-of-Model (CoM) in capturing long-range causal dependencies. It employs differentiable sparse gating, causal-masked attention, and a self-evolution gate to enable dynamic causal reasoning and continuous model adaptation. Evaluated on datasets like CLUTRR, CLADDER, EX-FEVER, and CausalQA, GoCE outperforms baseline LLMs in causal reasoning tasks.
Features

Latent-Causal Graph Builder: Maps tokens to sparse causal adjacency matrices.
Causal-Masked Multi-Head Attention: Enforces causal order in attention mechanisms.
Causal-MoE: Integrates sparse expert feed-forward networks for efficient reasoning.
Intervention & Counterfactual Module: Ensures consistency via KL divergence-based loss.
Self-Evolution Gate: Dynamically updates parameters for adaptive learning.

Results
GoCE improves Claude Sonnet 4â€™s CLUTRR Accuracy@K from 0.688 to 0.732, EX-FEVER EM from 0.681 to 0.730, and CausalQA IRS from 0.731 to 0.842, with similar gains in o4-mini-high and DeepSeek R1.
