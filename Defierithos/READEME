Deferithos: Self-Resonance Field Architecture

Overview
This repository implements the Deferithos architecture, introduced in the paper "Deferithos: The Lonely Warrior Rises from Resonance" by Libo Wang. Deferithos replaces traditional transformer self-attention with a self-resonance field (SRF) using waveform-based semantic processing to address computational complexity in long-sequence tasks. Evaluated on synthetic text data, HumanEval, and GSM8k datasets, Deferithos outperforms GPT4-Turbo-based transformers in metrics like ROUGE-L, METEOR, Pass@k, MMLU, Accuracy, and ARC-AGI.
Features

Self-Resonance Field (SRF): Utilizes wave interference for semantic association, eliminating token-based attention.
Waveform Imprint Representation: Converts text into continuous waveforms for dynamic semantic matching.
Wormhole Memory Space: Enables adaptive memory retrieval across dialogues.
Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Controller: Supports parallel processing for efficient reasoning.
Evaluation Metrics: ROUGE-L, METEOR, Pass@k, MMLU, Accuracy, ARC-AGI.

Results
Deferithos achieves a ROUGE-L of 0.72 (vs. 0.65 for transformers), with superior performance in Pass@k (0.85 vs. 0.78) and MMLU (0.80 vs. 0.74) across 50 training epochs.
