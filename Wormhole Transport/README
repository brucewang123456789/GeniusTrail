Wormhole Transport: Toward the Bridge of Artificial Spacetime

Overview
The Wormhole Transport Architecture, introduced in the paper "Wormhole Transport: Toward the Bridge of Artificial Spacetime" by Libo Wang, proposes a simulation-based framework to model stable wormhole structures for matter teleportation. Utilizing a pedagogical SDP five-module pipeline and a high-fidelity HQCOG adaptive pipeline, the architecture integrates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), DeepSDF, and sparse attention mechanisms. Implemented in Python 3.13 IDLE with a synthetic dataset of 1,000 object samples, it achieves high task success rate (~0.74), low chamfer distance (<0.01), and millisecond-level efficiency, demonstrating robust simulation of wormhole transport.
Key Features

IoT Capture & Sensor Fusion: Integrates multi-sensor data (LIDAR, RGB-D, etc.) with PTP synchronization.
PINN-Based Deconstruction: Optimizes PDE residuals for geometric and material latent vectors.
Quantum Wormhole Simulation: Simulates spacetime geometry with tensor compression.
Virtual Object Re-Organisation: Reconstructs objects with atomic-level precision.
Evaluation Metrics: Task Efficiency (TE), Task Success Rate (TSR), Channel Distance (CD), Throughput (TH), One-Way Delay (OWD).
